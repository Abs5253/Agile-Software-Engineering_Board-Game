# Toguz Korgool Board Game: Agile Software Engineering Project

This repository contains a public showcase version of our Software Engineering team project: a digital implementation of the strategy board game *Toguz Korgool*. The project placed a particular emphasis on Agile methodology, collaboration, and clean software engineering practices.



## üß† Overview

Toguz Korgul is a strategic two-player board game, traditionally played with seeds and pits. Our goal was to implement a playable digital version of the game with clean GUI development, using object-oriented design, with an emphasis on Agile software development practices. We adhered to the traditional rules of the game in our implementation, such as including a version of the mandatory handshake prior to playing, forgetting which the player forfeits the match!

The user can choose to play against 2 types of AI:
 - **Random Player** - selects move at random
 - **Greedy Player** - selects move which receives the immediate highest points. The Greedy AI does not as such strategise - it does not *plan ahead*, so a user can develop strategies to beat this.


## üß© My Contributions
My personal contributions focused on **backend development**: designing and **implementing the AI players**, for an easy and hard mode. The AI framework is made extendable such that any number of AI players could be added: one potential extention to consider is creating an even harder AI player which strategises ahead.

The focus on this project was writing clean, maintainable, extendable code implementing upon the functional and non-functional requirements we had developed (including nuances such as taking a few seconds before playing): overall, I and the other members all succeeded in this task.

I also took an initiative in organising the team, creating and then managing collaboration tools, such as clean practices in the Git repo, organising the Trello Kanban board, and taking part in managing sprints alongside David. We followed an iterative development cycle with regular sprint-reviews, and stand-ups. Our Code-review sessions focused on refactoring based on SOLID principles, and yielded clean code and high-coverage testing.

Overall, the team successfully delivered a polished, playable product built with clean, maintainable, and extendable code.
